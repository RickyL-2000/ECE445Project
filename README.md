# ECE445Project: Mimicry Stage Lighting Control System

ECE445 Senior Design

This project aims to build a mimicry stage lighting control system. It's an SLS that the light array will follow the direction of the operator's arms and imitate immediately, where the operator needs to hold two miniature joysticks.
